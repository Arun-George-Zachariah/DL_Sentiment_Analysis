yeah michael yeah cable thats the uhhh i had to hear him said it before i pronounced it,1
well i i dont know uhhh i i dont know the term date uhhh the flatbed uhhh the flatbed is probably a couple of years out ummm and uhhh i have been having problems with them so i mean its still a couple of years out but uhhhuhhuhuhh the reason they they kinda got us a hook line i think it was uhhh they their proposal was to used the chassi and i mean you the know body,1
and and just replace everything else  i guess yoyou know use the flatbed portion and keep that and just replace the engine and cab and stuff,1
so ummm and by that uhhh i mean the dollar amount that we saved it was was pretty good,1
so but now the issue is is that uhhhuh we keep having problems with this flatbed and uhhh man it just broke  weve had it in for service on the thirteenth on the sixteenth it broke down,1
so and you know thats thats thats an issue and we keep having issue so uhhh i wouldnt mind speaking to somebody but uhh,1
uhhh yeah i i i prefer they call first because i mean uhhuhh with with with business i mean ththis could slip in here and exactly,1
we ummm actually we have our own trucks now we used to the lease with ryder yeah it used to be uhh medallion but not no more now were ummm plantlife farms,1
and we went ahead and we had a new business partner who put some money down and he bought us all six new volvo trucks,1
yeah so were pretty set up with everything as far as trucking we dont need,1
ballpark of total units that i have i wanna say i have let me see threefourumm i have about thirteen units that we use,1
yeah we have some that were we were leasing that they get umm the free maintenance basically you just take them to the actual locations where you bought them from,1
but umm the one that we own yeah yeah those are basically some other leases that we have that they give us free maintenance but uhh the actual trucks that we bought we do that ourselves,1
i mean i mean well be interested for sure i mean i wouldnt even mind you know  i can give you my email if you like,1

well we i reached out to you guys once for a lot of a try one tractor out and and to try and get a unit in here was so to speak almost the price was outrageous the rental cost on it and i just wanted to try it out to see if i like the unit,1
and uhhh to go through all uhhh credit passing and everything else we just it just nothing was sorted out to be quite honest  like the rental rate for what they wanted on the unit was almost two times what i pay on normal rentals,1
okay i still have joes card here i still have your brochure and what not so,1
no i got one tractor which i have uhhh i probably got about nine months left on it,1
a week after would be better from me because i got my shipper on holiday next week so im running uhh the table so if we do it the week after we would be better off,1
umm probably after nine and umm i usually have to go to the bank about twelve or so and so uh anywhere anyanywhere between nine and twelve would be great,1
let me check it out and see  no i wont check it out not uhhumm i dont have to check it out  i have i have to have a surgery on next tuesday,1
oh yes but ill glad to get over and done with so i can see hahaaa,1

yeah i mean we we have we havent we haaa were were happy i guess i mean we have we have a good relationship with ryder  they dont umm we dont have any issues i guess,1
but i but of course if if michael you know  if there is if there is big price difference then were we are always going to look at you know what were gonna be able to cut our cost on and you know were all here to be profitable so,1
no i mean i havent i havent seen anybody in uhum in a while but i mean that to be honest with you you know most of the time if if its even ryder comes in here im pretty much like all right  yup ill let you know if i have an issue not like uhh a need you know a rep stopping in all time  if if michael if michael gets a hold of us and says hey this is this is the deal going on then then we sit down and discuss our options and may be may be call one of your reps to go over all the fine details of  if we were thinking about switching but you know that that would be the time that i would probably wanna see a rep uhhh until then i you know were just kinda stay out of school i guess,1
no no im not gonna im not gonna shunt him out of the door but if were busy of course yeah you know if were busy were busy so im gonna keep keep working,1
but we we used to be seven twenty and then switched to seven ten so of course anybody when we first opened had our information thats thats always seven twenty hahaaa,1
uhhh i dont know uh call me next monday and well well try to figure out a time,1
i gotcha  ummm its going all right with them uhhh that we dont have any complaints and then uhhh not know when that lease is gonna expire,1
yeah its its two flatbeds just uhhh yeah with the with a marking on the back like if you see back or front,1
thats too thats too far here for me to know but uhh but anyway uhh tell him to come on by ill talk to him for a second so,1
uhhhhum i dont think im interested uhhh yeah we do everything inhouse and i dont think im really interested,1
uhhhhh i dont know i mean we we kinda grab whatever is close and i dont know i mean it could be an opportunity  you youre welcome to to drop some information off thats fine  i kinda in and out a lot so uhhh it it will be in a mess but,1
cant remember whoever i cant remember who i gave it to they sure sold it,1
my email address and all where i you know i mean i did get some crazy stuff,1
uhhh sure is this for renting or for were were were not doing any rentals anymore,1
we we used to we used to deal with you guys down in a while,1
well uhh youre correct uhhhhh we do own most of our equipment uhhhhh and uhhh rather little bit complicated weve got a uhhh colossal help  company of course that uhhh we lease it from,1
and then also too we hired two mechanics that take care of our equipment sitting here uhh roughly uhhh i dont know about two million uhuh  dollars worth of those stuff  weve looked at leasing uhhh in the past uhhh id welcome a conversation uhhh with someone that would may be highlights some of the advantages of leasing but uhh i ive done this in the past uhhhhh  not avail but again you know im not going to close the door may be i can some some light can be shine on some uh things that i havent heard that before,1
yeah they have given me several uhhhuhh messages before and ive kind of tossed it around and i understand theyre theyre other bigger players so if anybody has anything to do teach me it might be all,1
trucks about two hundred thousand dollars im trying to buy and thats kind of a decision im trying to run through right now which direction i want to go with,1
yeah pretty yeah anytime really works were were always here if he wants to like schedule and make that,1
let me uhh just let me just log in back into my computer ill get my schedule up in a minute,1
uhh okay  my computer has been hanging up all day so ive been in and out restarts log offs hahaaa,1
tell you what you gonna have to send me that information im going to have to reply back to an email because i cant seem to,1
i believe madison boulevard is what uhhh its actually got like three names you know its got like three,1
alabama is the worse we dont have like we have a highway thats five sixty five then it turns into sixty five and then it turns into sixth avenue and then it turns into same street,1
yeah it it can be and you are not too far away from me at all so i probably say fifive minutes,1
man i know i know that we just got the current side last year so i can imagine itll be up the flat bed is two years old ummm,1
yeah his name is andrew uhhh he has called us a few times  i think his name is andrew,1
uhhhh you know well he is penskes rental guy because he runs into few trucks a couple of times to do so some deliveries youre right yeah,1
uhhh well the springfield used to be where hauling works main office was and we are rattled down has bought out the lubes division which is us down here in gilbert,1
uhhh yeah probably the fifteenth ummm probably here to pick  let me let just tell you a little bit about myself i retired at aahan i retired at the end of december so im only working parttime,1
hahahaaa aahan the the uhh the guy that you wanna talk to is uhhh his name is matt messick,1
and uhh hes him he is standing in my office at the moment i will i will tell him just this guy is from uhh penske he wants to come by and just talk about their maintenance program and i think when i when i talked to him in the past let me put you on my speak phone so you,1
you didnt hear me but what what i was interested in ummm when i talked to you guys before was ummm maintenance semitruck maintenance if you could do at our uhhh other locations like we have locations in uhh bakersfield and sacramento and phoenix and uhhh and and and we have here in jurupa valley we have uhumm a shop uhh a truck shop so we do all of our own stuff for the fleet thats here but we dont we dont uhmmm i was kinda interested in seeing what you could do for us at those in antioch at our san diego location and our bakersfield location and that kind of stuff,1
okay i have him so matts kinda hearing this the same way as you are because i havent really talked to him about this but uhhh but i thought i might be uhh more talking about to see if we could have a company like penske take care of those those areas but thats thats good to know that you do have ummm so so you you come out umm in the middle of the night or you come out in the daytime or which whats the maintenance truck would be coming you know hahaaa yeah maybe thats the conversation for when you guys come out here but uhhh matt he was asking if he could come out the week of the fifteenth for half hour or an hour or something like that,1
i dont know who i dont know who i talked to it has been it has been a while,1
okay well i should say i never hurt the crowd yeah ummm yeah any of those days tuesday wednesday or thursday just let me know and uhhh ill make sure im available,1
uhh phoenix uhh we got one in reno uhhh its actually its outside of reno but its reno branch but its actually in uhh carson city over there ummm,1
uhhh hang on for a second no i am not no im in uhh im in nashville on the ninth uhhhhh the the tenth uhhh i am free at two oclock,1
uhhh you come out here and and go over with this is that what you said,1
yeah uh let me check i know today is pretty booked up and so as tomorrow ummmtutututuu thursday is somewhat open ummm may be he come in in the afternoon ummm after one may be so anytime after one between one and four,1
uhhh we we were handling our own uhhh we dont have a vender in here at all,1
yeah it would be uhhh but uhmmmm my shop manager is uhh he is out right now,1
uhhh he had uhhh he had a medical issue so uhhh maybe maybe next month,1
give me uhh at you know at what the terms would be and then the milage rate,0
no actually i dont even have an interest in uhhh any leased vehicle or anything  im pretty much set with uhhh my rolling stock right now my units,0
well were actually umm actually preparing uhhh an rft to look at uhh an rft to look at uhh lease lease maintenance versus uhhh own and do our own maintenance so uhh i would wait for that to come out first before we do this,0
ii think were probably not interested in this we have some of our own mechanics and then we have umm,0
some other local shops that do our work and i i assume thats kinda where we wanna stay for now,0
uhhh im im good right now  i dont want  theythey will be wasting their time but uhhh right now im good  thank you anyhow,0
ummm you know the best thing is to be in contact and make an appointment,0
well im im not in the market for that right now  im im im trying to get back into market for it but right now,0
im just simply not in the market  were kinda kinda on hold  the owners are kinda on hold with that so,0
yeah yeah yeah if we get if i get where where i think i can do something yeah i would love to get david back in here and uhh and get some quotes from you guys on on another unit aa but at the moment now there would be just simply no need i think,0
because the owners uhh yeah the owners they are just not not interested right now,0
im at the mome im im after a moment on a weekly basis so you know until until they show some interest uhhh there is you know the only thing i can do is keep my compliance coming in on a regular basis to them and see see what happens but if they get interested in anything ill be sure to give you guys a call,0
uhhh thursday wouldnt work  why you dont have him call me on monday and well try to arrange a meeting,0
yeah wer were all set with with all that stuff  we were were not interested,0
is the local  yeah so so i actually talked to him not not that long ago  we we talked from time to time uhh so so we dont we dont necessarily have a sales need right now  we are we are getting some uhh uhh full uhh service lease units up here that were going to put down in the in the twin cities,0
uhhh but so you know we we we we will have that need down there but uhh but specifically uhhh for new units we dont we dont have a need right now but uhh but scott and i do talk uhh couple times a year,0
yeah no uhhh you know we have uhh we have four techs uhh and uhhh and a shop manger here that take care of all of our our units uhhh here other than what well be using uhhh in uhh in minneapolis with those full services leases so were were good here and and most of our other locations uhh other than other than loveland colorado have uhh heb shops as well and you guys are already doing the the leases in uhh in loveland anyway,0
yeah we do yup so our our shop takes care of that and and then we have a national account with michelin who takes care of our uhhh roadside tire things too so,0
um im just im just not interested  i we own everything work on it here  uh i rent a little bit of what i dont have and thats as far as i need to go with it,0
no that thats okay  i mean i try to do business here locally  uh  i put roofs on their business  i pave their parking lots  i do crane work forem so were go around,0
were really not interested  we are not doing any leasing right now  we have got everything uhh pretty much under control with some uhh good working capital so uhhh it would would be a waste of time okay,0
ummhmm okay yeah i think weve been in discussion with kevin and uhhh we were looking towards actually putting a a national contract in place and some of we agreed upon fedex rates etc but apart from that i believe there have there has been no engagement in terms of any other projects as such uhhh so you know from time to time we do have some ad hoc project requirements for example temperature control etc but i dont think penskes really been engaged uhh from that perspective and i dont know what youd recommend in terms of actually engaging umm this penske local folk in terms of a response for ad hoc projects,0
ummm i think next couple of weeks would be a little challenging actually but then yeah definitely i mean there have been discussions in terms of you know just engaging penske in terms of uhhh a national nonexclusive of course national contract umm so i believe based on you know how those discussions progress we would then look for them coming out and having discussions with us but i guess at this point of time i would say we should just keep that on hold but wewewe do get their we do get their at attention whenever we need it so were good for now,0
yeah might be int interested in that i got some umm tractors that are coming up next this year so but ummm next week uhhhh its a little bit premature right now were only into monday hahahhaha so i think ummm if he wants to send me uhhh couple of dates then ill look at my calendar,0
uhhhh whats his name  i have uhhh we have a rep coming at site in knoxville,0
no umm probably better if you just send me his info and may be i can talk to him over the phone,0
yeah we dont have any power of our own and we usually only rent if uhh drivers uhh truck goes down involved in an accident or something like that,0
oh i got there is a shop i mean i can go and rocking hit a shop right behind us,0
uhh truck diesel repair and they give us excellent deals because were right in front of them  were in the same we share the same parking lot,0
no that we dont need it we dont need the local rep to stop by uhhh weve purchased uhh we just bought a new truck last year,0
that would probably be be a waste of your time at this point because were currently under contract with ryder,0
well we have our own we have our own fleet here at our location in birmingham but with our eight satellite locations we lease all our,0
probably not right now umm we just uhh we got a new maintenance contract or something like that uhhh with uhmm or we or we did it with para transit were continuing the same uhh on the same lines on what we were before  the only overflow that we that we have is uhhh is going through ford right now ummm because there are all ford vehicles and um so we just umm made a contract with them so right now we wouldnt be doing anything umm so but ummm i appreciate youre reaching out though,0
ummm the expan the expansion that we have done ummm is hasnt been uhhh exactly what we thought it would be uhhh and the we have expanded it with another program out in sunrise area but there were using fords for that uhh right now umm its just so happens theyre  right across the street so the thing worked out just perfectly umm so right now we wouldnt be looking at anything i mean extra,0
okay well were we got a fullservice garages we got two garages that take care of missouri,0
okay uh im actually officed out of tulsa but i am also this week on my way to kansas city and then to st louis this week so where would you wanna i mean what would be the most convenient for you i mean as far as,0
it would be r roberts one the number one at bbu boy boy umbrella mail mail dot com,0
uh no actually im fixing breakfast with my family its not even uh eight oclock,0
okay well this is this is my home number and actually its a little early to be calling people anthony,0
anyway you could just send me an email and let me get with you on that,0
really cuz really and truly right now michelle i im down to one truck still got two trucks but hell ah right now im down to one running one truck right now uh but im definitely looking at doing something,0
yeah we um we we totally i know weve rented from you guys in the past but they but we we have our we built our fleet up now where we dont we totally wont need any rentals or or lease vehicles in the in the near future,0
mmm id i dont know i mean we we rent from you guys and i dont know if you can check your history but we we rent uhhh multiple times which is like a van or a cargo van or something,0
im kinda bent plus i went home early yesterday umm get over something im sick but uhh i dont know i mean why whats whats is he just going to go over rates,0
well i mean we we have so we actually have a uhhh uhhh i mean we we rent from you guys but we have a full fulltime lease actually with ryder that we had for uhhh a little over a year and half actually,0
so eveeveeven though we have it with them that doesnt keep me from you know rent from whoever we wanna rent from whatever is convenient wherever so,0
uhhh uhh i mean i if if if you got deals going on or something i if you just want to email it to me and ill in that way i can print it out and put it on my board here,0
so always have it uhhh that would that would work for me  i dont necessarily see the purpose of a meeting since i already rent from you guys haahaa,0
yeah about a year and half or so i think then may be two years,0
oh yeah its uhh it was four brand new truck built to our built to our uhh needs,0
you know i think you must have the wrong number umm my name is happens to be john as well possibly wewewe do we were leasing from penske but we bought a truck from you guys,0
are are with harinam harinam and yeah i mean im im over in oklahoma right now so,0
yeah yeah it has gotten six hundred thousand miles on it right now and we bought with five sixty so the last fortyforty thousand have been great i mean ive had a few little hiccups but nothing bad at all and now well be looking at getting more soon uhuaa you said you guys had a promotion going on right now tell me more about it,0
right well well  you know i think we were we had nineteen fifty with us and thirteen cents a mile nineteen fifty a month and thirteen cents a mile i thought we we are running umm,0
with two year lease yeah whawhat it hohow much more competitive are you guys getting now,0
you know i could could could need a truck by next month you know honestly  if i was gonna you know branch out i  was just planning on it but if theres opportunity you know comes by knocking so,0
okay perfect perfect  all right john hey i appreciate ill well we are gonna reach back out to you shortly okaythank you sir take care,0
yeah but im im im pretty good right now uhh i dont need to be re imprinted or nothing,0
uh um yeah i mean we talk um would you like to let me know you know what is going on um but if its in regards to new business i will say that we are locked in with ryder,0
i mean i mean you can and you know i appreciate the interest but you know quite time for you its gonna,0
its going to be probably waste your time because you know we we are contractually locked in with them and um ,0
and for the yeah the small fleet of the truck that we have gets taking care by a number of local shops and dealerships,0
ummmm i think we have had in the the few years there have been here for a while so,0
in prior years weve had a few different entities look at fleet maintenance and fleet service and even leasing and such and that hasnt just never has panned out for us,0
yeah its like i said this is since we are such a small agency and then you know limited number of larger pieces of equipment and certainly you see penske all over the place but usually the independent locale at the center in lager entities or metropolitan water districts or you know,0
yeah why dont you go and email me what you have and then ill ill pass it on,0
go ahead and email me what you can and ill and ill forward it of to them,0
yeah ive never had anything from penske  they keep calling and everything and and i never used penske because i always buy my trucks outright,0
oh yeah im im i am just at a stop light right now so go ahead,0
what happened since uhh pretty much our last clear communication a year ago we we have now decided uhh to purchase rather than to lease,0
so we purchase uh a truck uhh a new truck and uhh at least now it will you know and i guess it was just uh our financial man decided that because we intend to have it for long term and everything like that that that was the best thing for us to do,0
thats just what happened uh the only thing now yeah weve weve branded some uhh trucks haha so weve done that but uh beyond that yeah were not going to be looking for any kind of long term leases any time soon so where we are,0
well yeah right now because you know its under warranty uhh wewe take it while we are in town then i can we take it up to appleton where we purchased it and for service uh because uhh i dont know we took enough there we just feel its better for at least during the uhh uhhh during the warranty time anyhow so,0
so you know thats right after the warrantys off uhh it will be whole different uhh situation i think you know,0
good question uh i am not sure if its a one year or three year warranty yeah its mileage related but we never we dont drive enough miles so uhh it will be time thing more than anything else  i think its uhh like uhh three years or so weve had it uhh we havent even had it a year yet so,0
we wouldnt wanna swear that it is three years because uhh i knew all a lot when we when we were buying and comparing it and everything else with you know diesel versus gas and we found out that you know diesel is not for us and so that type of the things so uh that was one of the things so uhh that was it so,0
yeah we would be interested in that uh one particularly uh well i dont know wowo as i think its a big dark shake up wewe had a scratch on uhh on uh the box of the truck and uhh so we ended up having to taken up there and so we had to rent one of your trucks for a week deal hah or three or four days while they repaired it and uhh so obviously once the and you know just because they thought they would do a better job not that it was warranty or anything else but uhuh we are at we just thought that was a better thing to do so uh so we were  bought up for three or four days but i think thats the only other time and then normally what we do is uh uh we are taking it up there for service during the warranty just to you know not have problem telling why you know they didnt do this right you know so,0
uh were taking it back to veer a moment you know until the warranty is off and i dont know whether its a one year or three year to be honest i knew it when we bought it because i negotiated it,0
so anyhow i think thats where we are now when the warranty is off its a its a whole different ball game were were gonna wanna do it locally or at the lowest lowest cost and well,0
well next week is uhhhh a bad well actually this month is a bad lit month uh sometime you know in the future i guess ill have to look into that see what kind of warranty we have on it because if its if its a three year warranty its not much use i am talking about it now you know,0
and uh and it seems to me  it is but uhh and it is um its also a milage thing and i know we wont hit the milage because we only drive a five to six thousand miles a year probably sooyeah just lock on thats why we didnt go to diesel and a lot of other things it basically ended up that its the only truck that we could really uh use you know haha uh,0
and if uh because we after finding out that diesel would be a terrible decision for us uh for it starts and stop and cold and all that happens so ,0
week after or next uh next week and lot lots of meetings and negotiations and the following week im gone if so thats why i said i dont come back until the end of march uhh i dont know so,0
you know i think sometime anytime after first of april thing should slow down a little bit so lets see what happens,0
yeah he can give me a call then and in the meantime ill try and look up and see uhh you know if we have a three year warranty and i mean if it is im not going to discuss service from the end and i mean may be two years from now or we would well see what happens okay,0
um im having a meeting with jeff neal at ten oclock next tuesday i believe ,0
prior and jeff looks like mike prior and and jeff neal are going to be here at ten oclock on tuesday,0
and uhh in the way of resource youre just talking about uhh truck rental or that was ,0
okay uhhh do do this for me nate i mean were were in the height of ours as i call it silly season in the exhibit trade show business,0
uhh so probably its probably going to be between itll be at least mid april before im going to have anytime i mean i work we work about thirty hours over the weekend and now were doing and show show support mode so if i if and its not that im opposed to talking to some one of your folks but if im going to take time to to talk then i dont want to have to cut anybody short i want to you know so someone is going to come over to spend their time then i want to be fair to them if they come over here so lets do this  let lets lets touch back base say like either like a week of the tenth of april because between now and middle of the next month its just going to be crazy,0
yeah and i i apologize for that but just just were just in the height of our convention trade show season so i dont want to have somebody come and waste our time and we say hey you know i got five minutes so thats all i can give,0
we have a we have a certain spec we have to have so we have to have a real long wheel base truck and i know youre not going to have that but you know you know probably it wouldnt be worth of time coming by,0
uhh it probably its probably not option for us right now so i probably would not probably would not want to do that,0
